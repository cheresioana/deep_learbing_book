# Deep Learbing Book exercises

Here are some notes that I have taken while reading Deep Learning with Python, Second Edition - by Fran√ßois Chollet. 
It can be used as a quick overview of the book or gather some knowledge.

Here is a link for the official jupyterNotebooks of the book https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks 

## Structure
Each chapter has its own jupyter notebook with some of my notes, practical exercises and some snippets from the book.

The Notes.pdf is a file with some of my notes. They are written by hand since writing dtuff makes me remember more easily. Hope it is readable for others too.

## How to run

just install all the dependencies from requirements.txt and run the jupyter notebook
